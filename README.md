- I used to own <a href="https://wingsxi.com/" target="_blank">WingsXI</a> until January 2023.  Much of my development history there can be found over on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gweivyth" target="_blank">Gitlab,</a> which was my primary git platform during this time.

- I'm currently a community manager for a game with over 300,000 active monthly users.

- My primary programming languages are Lua, C++, C#, HTML5/CSS, SQL, Python, Javascript, and Visual Basic.

- I have experience administering and developing private servers for MMORPGs including Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, building tabletop gaming systems, and creating music.  My current project is a trading card game called The Burning Dawn.
