<h1 align="center">Hi internet denizens!</h1>
<h3 align="center">I'm Alex, and I love building games!</h3>

- I used to own <a href="https://wingsxi.com/" target="_blank">WingsXI</a> until January 2023.  Much of my development history there can be found over on my <a href="https://gitlab.com/Gweivyth" target="_blank">Gitlab,</a> which is my primary git platform.

- These days, I'm enjoying relative peace and quiet while finishing a degree in Computer Programming!

- I have experience administering and developing private servers for MMORPGs including Final Fantasy XI and World of Warcraft, building tabletop gaming systems, and creating music.  My current project is a trading card game called The Burning Dawn.

- Just getting back into the Final Fantasy XI emulation scene, currently contributing to LandSandBoat.

- I'd consider my skills slightly above moderate in Lua, C++, and SQL, although I am always learning.  I am extremely comfortable with HTML5, CSS, and PHP.

- Feel free to reach out to me at **admin@gweivyth.com** or any of the below platforms.
